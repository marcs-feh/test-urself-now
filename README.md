# Test urself, NOW!

This is a quick and dirty header for testing in C and C++, it is quite "assert
oriented" to allow for extensions such as checking globals for exceptions,
intercepting panics etc.

Look at `example.c` or just read the header, this is *very* simple code to the
point where there's no point making documentation.
